	abstract = { The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern evades antibody-mediated immunity that comes from vaccination or infection with earlier variants due to accumulation of numerous spike mutations. To understand the Omicron antigenic shift, we determined cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystal structures of the spike protein and the receptor-binding domain bound to the broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody (mAb) S309 (the parent mAb of sotrovimab) and to the human ACE2 receptor. We provide a blueprint for understanding the marked reduction of binding of other therapeutic mAbs that leads to dampened neutralizing activity. Remodeling of interactions between the Omicron receptor-binding domain and human ACE2 likely explains the enhanced affinity for the host receptor relative to the ancestral virus. },

               Neutralization titers of Omicron by sera from vaccinees and
               convalescent subjects infected with early pandemic Alpha, Beta,
               Gamma, or Delta are substantially reduced, or the sera failed to

               unleash evolution driven by immune escape. This leads to a large

               the virus might become globally dominant. Further, the high
               number of mutations in the viral spike protein raised concerns
               that the virus might evade antibodies induced by infection or
               vaccination. Here, we report that the Omicron spike was
               resistant against most therapeutic antibodies but remained
               susceptible to inhibition by sotrovimab. Similarly, the Omicron
               spike evaded neutralization by antibodies from convalescent
               patients or individuals vaccinated with the BioNTech-Pfizer
               vaccine (BNT162b2) with 12- to 44-fold higher efficiency than
               the spike of the Delta variant. Neutralization of the Omicron

               Zeneca-Oxford)/BNT162b2 vaccination or vaccination with three

               still evaded neutralization more efficiently than the Delta
               spike. These findings indicate that most therapeutic antibodies
               will be ineffective against the Omicron variant and that double

  abstract  = "The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations
               of the receptor-binding domain (RBD). How Omicron evades
               RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate
               investigation. Here we use high-throughput yeast display
               screening1,2 to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations
               for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the
               neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised
               clustering into six epitope groups (A-F)-a grouping that is
               highly concordant with knowledge-based structural
               classifications3-5. Various single mutations of Omicron can
               impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups.
               Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A-D, the
               epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are
               largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R. Antibodies in
               group E (for example, S309)6 and group F (for example, CR3022)7,
               which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity,
               are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing
               antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L.
               Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that
               neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could
               also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their
               epitopes. In total, over 85\% of the tested neutralizing
               antibodies were escaped by Omicron. With regard to
               neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of
               LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and
               BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and
               DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy. Together, our
               data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in
               considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing
               antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will
               remain most effective. Our results inform the development of
               antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future
               variants.",
